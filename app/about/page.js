        Hey, I am Tanvi! 
        Growing up running around skateparks and playing the drums, I discovered two things . Firstly, I found joy and beauty in the people around me and second, a subconcious passion for creativity. Lately, I’ve been captivated by two things: creative storytelling and liminal spaces– those moments or places that feel both familiar and unknown. They inspire me to explore the intersection of the ordinary and the extraordinary.
        I thrive on experimentation, uncovering and envisioning ideas that push boundaries and live in the future.
